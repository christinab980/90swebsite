**Position**
The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top , right , bottom , and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

**Absolute**
An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed . The top , right , bottom , and left properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block.  Absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it

**Fixed**
An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

**Static**
static is the default position for HTML elements. Elements with position: static are positioned based on the normal flow of the page, as you would expect them to be without any CSS styling. Elements with positioning as static are not affected by any of the CSS Positioning properties (left, right, top and bottom).

**Relative**
Relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it.
