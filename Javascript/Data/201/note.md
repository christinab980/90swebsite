## Data types can be collection in other structures like objects and arrays

### Objects 

An object describes something. It lives inside of opening and closing clury braces and it organized as key:vale pairs, serated by commas. The key and the value are themselves seperated by a ; . An object is not a data type. 

```
const car = {
    color: 'green',
    mileage: '67302',
    isNew: false
};

```

### Arrays
An array is list of items. It defined by opening and closing square brackets. The items in the array are seperated by commas, each item in an array is indexed with a number and arrays can contain all other data types as well as objects. 

```
const shoppingList = ['apples', 'celery', 'bread'];
const ages = [7, 7, 7.5, 8],

const  cars [
    
    const car = {
    color: 'green',
    mileage: '67302',
    isNew: false
    },

 const car = {
    color: 'red',
    mileage: '12301',
    isNew: false
    },
    
const car = {
    color: 'blue',
    mileage: '120432',
    isNew: false
    },
    
    ]
    
```
