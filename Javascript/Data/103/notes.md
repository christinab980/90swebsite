# JavaScript Data 103
## The data types for 'null' and 'undefined' are a little different

### 'null'

```
let captainName = null;
console.log(captainName) --> null 

null means an absent of value - and intentional null 

```

### 'undefined' 

```
let manager; 
console.log(manager) --> undefined 

meaning that there is no = value to the manager


```

'null' and 'undefined' are values but also types -
